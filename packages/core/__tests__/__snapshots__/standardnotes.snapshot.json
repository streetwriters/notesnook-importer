      "data": "<h2>Moving beyond localStorage</h2><h3>IndexedDB &#x26;\n WebCrypto</h3><p>It's hard to believe that as of 2016, the\n best method for offline storage in a web app was\n localStorage, a simple key-value store with a 5mb data\n limit. These kinds of stores are typically meant to store\n user preferences and basic user information. So if you\n wanted to build an application that offered end-to-end\n encryption AND search capability, you couldn't. For this\n reason, we have had to make compromises in our privacy, at\n a cost that is everyday becoming more expensive.</p><p>But\n while we were selling our privacy cheaply and letting\n companies run amuck with our data, a brave few engineers\n have been building the future of the web, and we have yet\n to take full notice.</p><p>Search and encryption are one\n another's arch enemies. Simply put, you can't offer\n convenient search on top of encrypted data. And since most\n of the heavy lifting and data processing in web apps today\n are performed server side, servers <em>require</em> read\n access to all data. But if the server could read your data,\n then practically any engineer of the company could read\n your data, and if an engineer could read your data, then so\n could you know who.</p><p>Companies have been clutching on\n to this excuse with great leisure, and we have capitulated\n to their seemingly well reasoned response. However, in this\n great again year of 2017 which we find ourselves in today,\n that answer no longer holds up.</p><p>WebCrypto and\n IndexedDB are the one-two punch to a new era of encrypted,\n offline, and privacy centric web applications.</p><p>Before\n WebCrypto, practical applications wanting to perform crypto\n and encryption methods in the browser relied on libraries\n like CrpytoJS, a painfully slow library without access to\n proper system resources and lacking, amongst other things,\n a cryptographically secure random number generator.\n WebCrypto on the other hand is, to the most accurate\n description I could think of, a beast. Whereas the\n performance of a key derivation function like PBKDF2 in\n CryptoJS clocked in at around 5,000 hashes in 6 seconds, my\n simple WebCrypto tests had no problem running 1.5 million\n hashes in less than a second. This is the crypto library\n that the world of web apps have been so desperately\n awaiting.</p><p>On the other end is IndexedDB: a full,\n structured, and queriable database with a data capacity\n limit of 50% of the user's disk space, available right in\n the browser. As of 2016, all major browsers support it,\n including mobile browsers. This means applications like\n those that center around private user data can now easily\n encrypt data locally, send encrypted data to the server,\n and store decrypted data locally in the privacy of the user's\n own database.</p><p>The excuse not to take advantage of\n these long awaited set of privacy-fulfilling tools that\n users are desperately craving is no longer technical, but\n philosophical and economical. Some companies cherish user\n data far too much to ever forego not being able to read it\n themselves. You know which companies I'm referring to. They\n will continue ignoring user demand for privacy at their own\n peril.</p><p>Web developers: the tools for disruption are\n now at your feet.</p><hr /><p><em>We've implemented both\n  WebCrypto and IndexedDB into our own web-based notes app,\n  Standard Notes, for end-to-end encryption and full offline\n  search with surprisingly great ease and little resistance.</em></p><p><em>More\n  info on <a\n   href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API\">WebCrypto</a>\n  and <a\n   href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API\">IndexedDB</a>.\n  The docs for IndexedDB state that it\n  \"is powerful, but may seem too complicated for simple cases\",\n  but this absolutely wasn't the case for us. The API is\n  delightfully high level.</em></p>",

If all time is eternally present\n All time is unredeemable. What might have been is an\n abstraction Remaining a perpetual possibility Only in a\n world of speculation. What might have been and what has\n been Point to one end, which is always present. Footfalls\n echo in the memory Down the passage which we did not take\n Towards the door we never opened Into the rose-garden. My\n words echo Thus, in your mind. But to what purpose\n Disturbing the dust on a bowl of rose-leaves I do not know.</p><p>Other\n echoes Inhabit the garden. Shall we follow? Quick, said the\n bird, find them, find them, Round the corner. Through the\n first gate, Into our first world, shall we follow The\n deception of the thrush? Into our first world. There they\n were, dignified, invisible, Moving without pressure, over\n the dead leaves, In the autumn heat, through the vibrant\n air, And the bird called, in response to The unheard music\n hidden in the shrubbery, And the unseen eyebeam crossed,\n for the roses Had the look of flowers that are looked at.\n There they were as our guests, accepted and accepting. So\n we moved, and they, in a formal pattern, Along the empty\n alley, into the box circle, To look down into the drained\n pool. Dry the pool, dry concrete, brown edged, And the pool\n was filled with water out of sunlight, And the lotos rose,\n quietly, quietly, The surface glittered out of heart of\n light, And they were behind us, reflected in the pool. Then\n a cloud passed, and the pool was empty. Go, said the bird,\n for the leaves were full of children, Hidden excitedly,\n containing laughter. Go, go, go, said the bird: human kind\n Cannot bear very much reality. Time past and time future\n What might have been and what has been Point to one end,\n which is always present.</p><p>II</p><p>Garlic and\n sapphires in the mud Clot the bedded axle-tree. The\n trilling wire in the blood Sings below inveterate scars\n Appeasing long forgotten wars. The dance along the artery\n The circulation of the lymph Are figured in the drift of\n stars Ascend to summer in the tree We move above the moving\n tree In light upon the figured leaf And hear upon the\n sodden floor Below, the boarhound and the boar Pursue their\n pattern as before But reconciled among the stars.</p><p>At\n the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor\n fleshless; Neither from nor towards; at the still point,\n there the dance is, But neither arrest nor movement. And do\n not call it fixity, Where past and future are gathered.\n Neither movement from nor towards, Neither ascent nor\n decline. Except for the point, the still point, There would\n be no dance, and there is only the dance. I can only say,\n there we have been: but I cannot say where. And I cannot\n say, how long, for that is to place it in time. The inner\n freedom from the practical desire, The release from action\n and suffering, release from the inner And the outer\n compulsion, yet surrounded By a grace of sense, a white\n light still and moving, Erhebung without motion,\n concentration Without elimination, both a new world And the\n old made explicit, understood In the completion of its\n partial ecstasy, The resolution of its partial horror. Yet\n the enchainment of past and future Woven in the weakness of\n the changing body, Protects mankind from heaven and\n damnation Which flesh cannot endure. Time past and time\n future Allow but a little consciousness. To be conscious is\n not to be in time But only in time can the moment in the\n rose-garden, The moment in the arbour where the rain beat,\n The moment in the draughty church at smokefall Be\n remembered; involved with past and future. Only through\n time time is conquered.</p><p>III</p><p>Here is a place of\n disaffection Time before and time after In a dim light:\n neither daylight Investing form with lucid stillness\n Turning shadow into transient beauty Wtih slow rotation\n suggesting permanence Nor darkness to purify the soul\n Emptying the sensual with deprivation Cleansing affection\n from the temporal. Neither plentitude nor vacancy. Only a\n flicker Over the strained time-ridden faces Distracted from\n distraction by distraction Filled with fancies and empty of\n meaning Tumid apathy with no concentration Men and bits of\n paper, whirled by the cold wind That blows before and after\n time, Wind in and out of unwholesome lungs Time before and\n time after. Eructation of unhealthy souls Into the faded\n air, the torpid Driven on the wind that sweeps the gloomy\n hills of London, Hampstead and Clerkenwell, Campden and\n Putney, Highgate, Primrose and Ludgate. Not here Not here\n the darkness, in this twittering world.</p><p>Descend\n lower, descend only Into the world of perpetual solitude,\n World not world, but that which is not world, Internal\n darkness, deprivation And destitution of all property,\n Dessication of the world of sense, Evacuation of the world\n of fancy, Inoperancy of the world of spirit; This is the\n one way, and the other Is the same, not in movement But\n abstention from movememnt; while the world moves In\n appetency, on its metalled ways Of time past and time\n future.</p><p>IV</p><p>Time and the bell have buried the\n day, the black cloud carries the sun away. Will the\n sunflower turn to us, will the clematis Stray down, bend to\n us; tendril and spray Clutch and cling? Chill Fingers of\n yew be curled Down on us? After the kingfisher's wing Has\n answered light to light, and is silent, the light is still\n At the still point of the turning world.</p><p>V</p><p>Words\n move, music moves Only in time; but that which is only\n living Can only die. Words, after speech, reach Into the\n silence. Only by the form, the pattern, Can words or music\n reach The stillness, as a Chinese jar still Moves\n perpetually in its stillness. Not the stillness of the\n violin, while the note lasts, Not that only, but the\n co-existence, Or say that the end precedes the beginning,\n And the end and the beginning were always there Before the\n beginning and after the end. And all is always now. Words\n strain, Crack and sometimes break, under the burden, Under\n the tension, slip, slide, perish, Will not stay still.\n Shrieking voices Scolding, mocking, or merely chattering,\n Always assail them. The Word in the desert Is most attacked\n by voices of temptation, The crying shadow in the funeral\n dance, The loud lament of the disconsolate chimera.</p><p>The\n detail of the pattern is movement, As in the figure of the\n ten stairs. Desire itself is movement Not in itself\n desirable; Love is itself unmoving, Only the cause and end\n of movement, Timeless, and undesiring Except in the aspect\n of time Caught in the form of limitation Between un-being\n and being. Sudden in a shaft of sunlight Even while the\n dust moves There rises the hidden laughter Of children in\n the foliage Quick now, here, now, always- Ridiculous the\n waste sad time Stretching before and after.</p><p>East\n Coker</p><p>I</p><p>In my beginning is my end. In\n succession Houses rise and fall, crumble, are extended, Are\n removed, destroyed, restored, or in their place Is an open\n field, or a factory, or a by-pass. Old stone to new\n building, old timber to new fires, Old fires to ashes, and\n ashes to the earth Which is already flesh, fur and faeces,\n Bone of man and beast, cornstalk and leaf. Houses live and\n die: there is a time for building And a time for living and\n for generation And a time for the wind to break the\n loosened pane And to shake the wainscot where the\n field-mouse trots And to shake the tattered arras woven\n with a silent motto.</p><p>In my beginning is my end. Now\n the light falls Across the open field,, leaving the deep\n lane Shuttered with branches, dark in the afternoon, Where\n you lean against a bank while a van passes, And the deep\n lane insists on the direction Into the village, in the\n elctric heat Hypnotised. In a warm haze the sultry light Is\n absorbed, not refracted, by grey stone. The dahlias sleep\n in the empty silence. Wait for the early owl.</p><p>In that\n open field If you do not come too close, if you do not come\n too close, On a summer midnight, you can hear the music Of\n the weak pipe and the little drum And see them dancing\n around the bonfire the association of man and woman In\n daunsinge, signifying matrimonie˜ A dignified and\n commodious sacrament. Two and two, necessarye coniunction,\n Holding eche other by the hand or the arm Whiche betokeneth\n concorde. Round and round the fire Leaping through the\n flames, or joined in circles, Rustically solemn or in\n rustic laughter Lifting heavy feet in clumsy shoes, Earth\n feet, loam feet, lifted in country mirth Mirth of those\n long since under earth Nourishing the corn. Keeping time,\n Keeping the rhythm in their dancing As in their living in\n the living seasons The time of the seasons and the\n constellations The time of milking and the time of harvest\n The time of the coupling of man and woman And that of\n beasts. Feet rising and falling. Eating and drinking. Dung\n and death.</p><p>Dawn points, and another day Prepares for\n heat and silence. Out at sea the dawn wind Wrinkles and\n slides. I am here Or there, or elsewhere. In my beginning.</p><p>II</p><p>What\n is the late November doing With the disturbance of the\n spring And creatures of the summer heat, And snowdrops\n writhing under feet And hollyhocks that aim too high Red\n into grey and tumble down Late roses filled with early\n snow? Thunder rolled by the rolling stars Simulates\n triumphal cars Deployed in constellated wars Scorpion\n fights against the Sun Until the Sun and Moon go down\n Comets weep and Leonids fly Hunt the heavens and the plains\n Whirled in a vortex that shall bring The world to that\n destructive fire Which burns before the ice-cap reigns.</p><p>That\n was a way of putting it - not very satisfactory: A\n periphrastic study in a worn-out poetical fashion, Leaving\n one still with the intolerable wrestle With words and\n meanings. The poetry does not matter. It was not (to start\n again) what one had expected. What was to be the value of\n the long looked forward to, Long hoped for calm, the\n autumnal serenity And the wisdom of age? Had they deceived\n us, Or deceived themselves, the quiet-voiced elders,\n Bequeathing us merely a receipt for deceit? The serenity\n only a deliberate hebetude, The wisdom only the knowledge\n of dead secrets Useless in the darkness into which they\n peered Or from which they turned their eyes. There is, it\n seems to us, At best, only a limited value In the knowledge\n derived from experience. The knowledge inposes a pattern,\n and falsifies, For the pattern is new in every moment And\n every moment is a new and shocking Valuation of all we have\n been. We are only undeceived Of that which, deceiving,\n could no longer harm. In the middle, not only in the middle\n of the way but all the way, in a dark wood, in a bramble,\n On the edge of a grimpen, where is no secure foothold, And\n menaced by monsters, fancy lights, Risking enchantment. Do\n not let me hear Of the wisdom of old men, but rahter of\n their folly, Their fear of fear and frenzy, their fear of\n possession, Of belonging to another, or to others, or to\n God. The only wisdom we can hope to acquire Is the wisdom\n of humility: humility is endless.</p><p>The houses are all\n gone under the sea.</p><p>The dancers are all gone under\n the hill.</p><p>III</p><p>O dark dark dark. They all go\n into the dark, The vacant interstellar spaces, the vacant\n into the vacant, The captains, merchant bankers, eminent\n men of letters, The generous patrons of art, the statesmen\n and the rulers, Distinguished civil servants, chairmen of\n many committees, Industrial lords and petty contractors,\n all go into the dark, And dark the Sun and Moon, and the\n Almanach de Gotha And the Stock Exchange Gazette, the\n Directory of Directors, And cold the sense and lost the\n motive of action. And we all go with them, into the silent\n funeral, Nobody's funeral, for there is no one to bury. I\n said to my soul, be still, and let the dark come upon you\n Which shall be the darkness of God. As, in a theatre, The\n lights are extinguished, for the scene to be changed With a\n hollow rumble of wings, with a movement of darkness on\n darkness, And we know that the hills and the trees, the\n distant panorama And the bold imposing facade are all being\n rolled away- Or as, when an underground train, in the tube,\n stops too long between stations And the conversation rises\n and slowly fades into silence And you see behind every face\n the mental emptiness deepen Leaving only the growing terror\n of nothing to think about; Or when, under ether, the mind\n is conscious but conscious of nothing- I said to my soul,\n be still, and wait without hope For hope would be hope for\n the wrong thing; wait without love, For love would be love\n of the wrong thing; there is yet faith But the faith and\n the love and the hope are all in the waiting. Wait without\n thought, for you are not ready for thought: So the darkness\n shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing. Whisper\n of running streams, and winter lightning. The wild thyme\n unseen and the wild strawberry, The laughter in the garden,\n echoed ecstasy Not lost, but requiring, pointing to the\n agony Of death and birth.</p><p>You say I am repeating\n Something I have said before. I shall say it again. Shall I\n say it again? In order to arrive there, To arrive where you\n are, to get from where you are not, You must go by a way\n wherein there is no ecstacy. In order to arrive at what you\n do not know You must go by a way which is the way of\n ignorance. In order to possess what you do not possess You\n must go by the way of dispossession. In order to arrive at\n what you are not You must go through the way in which you\n are not. And what you do not know is the only thing you\n know And what you own is what you do not own And where you\n are is where you are not.</p><p>IV</p><p>The wounded\n surgeon plies the steel That quesions the distempered part;\n Beneath the bleeding hands we feel The sharp compassion of\n the healer's art Resolving the enigma of the fever chart.</p><p>Our\n only health is the disease If we obey the dying nurse Whose\n constant care is not to please But to remind us of our, and\n Adam's curse, And that, to be restored, our sickness must\n grow worse.</p><p>The whole earth is our hospital Endowed\n by the ruined millionaire, Wherein, if we do well, we shall\n Die of the absolute paternal care That will not leave us,\n but prevents us everywhere.</p><p>The chill ascends from\n feet to knees, The fever sings in mental wires. If to be\n warmed, then I must freeze And quake in frigid purgatorial\n fires Of which the flame is roses, and the smoke is briars.</p><p>The\n dripping blood our only drink, The bloody flesh our only\n food: In spite of which we like to think That we are sound,\n substantial flesh and blood- Again, in spite of that, we\n call this Friday good.</p><p>V</p><p>So here I am, in the\n middle way, having had twenty years- Twenty years largely\n wasted, the years of l'entre deux guerres- Trying to use\n words, and every attempt Is a wholy new start, and a\n different kind of failure Because one has only learnt to\n get the better of words For the thing one no longer has to\n say, or the way in which One is no longer disposed to say\n it. And so each venture Is a new beginning, a raid on the\n inarticulate, With shabby equipment always deteriorating In\n the general mess of imprecision of feeling, Undisciplined\n squads of emotion. And what there is to conquer By strength\n and submission, has already been discovered Once or twice,\n or several times, by men whom one cannot hope To emulate -\n but there is no competition - There is only the fight to\n recover what has been lost And found and lost again and\n again: and now, under conditions That seem unpropitious.\n But perhaps neither gain nor loss. For us, there is only\n the trying. The rest is not our business.</p><p>Home is\n where one starts from. As we grow older the world becomes\n stranger, the pattern more complicated Of dead and living.\n Not the intense moment Isolated, with no before and after,\n But a lifetime burning in every moment And not the lifetime\n of one man only But of old stones that cannot be\n deciphered. There is a time for the evening under\n starlight, A time for the evening under lamplight (The\n evening with the photograph album). Love is most nearly\n itself When here and now cease to matter. Old men ought to\n be explorers Here or there does not matter We must be still\n and still moving Into another intensity For a further\n union, a deeper communion Through the dark cold and the\n empty desolation, The wave cry, the wind cry, the vast\n waters Of the petrel and the porpoise. In my end is my\n beginning.</p><p>The Dry Salvages</p><p>I</p><p>I do not\n know much about gods; but I think that the river Is a\n strong brown god - sullen, untamed and intractable, Patient\n to some degree, at first recognised as a frontier; Useful,\n untrustworthy, as a conveyor of commerce; Then only a\n problem confronting the builder of bridges. The problem\n once solved, the brown god is almost forgotten By the\n dwellers in cities - ever, however, implacable. Keeping his\n seasons, and rages, destroyer, reminder Of what men choose\n to forget. Unhonoured, unpropitiated By worshippers of the\n machine, but waiting, watching and waiting. His rhythm was\n present in the nursery bedroom, In the rank ailanthus of\n the April dooryard, In the smell of grapes on the autumn\n table, And the evening circle in the winter gaslight.</p><p>The\n river is within us, the sea is all about us; The sea is the\n land's edge also, the granite, Into which it reaches, the\n beaches where it tosses Its hints of earlier and other\n creation: The starfish, the horseshoe crab, the whale's\n backbone; The pools where it offers to our curiosity The\n more delicate algae and the sea anemone. It tosses up our\n losses, the torn seine, The shattered lobsterpot, the\n broken oar And the gear of foreign dead men. The sea has\n many voices, Many gods and many voices. The salt is on the\n briar rose, The fog is in the fir trees. The sea howl And\n the sea yelp, are different voices Often together heard:\n the whine in the rigging, The menace and caress of wave\n that breaks on water, The distant rote in the granite\n teeth, And the wailing warning form the approaching\n headland Are all sea voices, and the heaving groaner\n Rounded homewards, and the seagull: And under the\n oppression of the silent fog The tolling bell Measures time\n not our time, rung by the unhurried Ground swell, a time\n Older than the time of chronometers, older Than time\n counted by anxious worried women Lying awake, calculating\n the future, Trying to unweave, unwind, unravel And piece\n together the past and the future, Between midnight and\n dawn, when the past is all deception, The future\n futureless, before the morning watch Whem time stops and\n time is never ending; And the ground swell, that is and was\n from the beginning, Clangs The bell.</p><p>II</p><p>Where\n is there an end of it, the soundless wailing, The silent\n withering of autumn flowers Dropping their petals and\n remaining motionless; Where is there and end to the\n drifting wreckage, The prayer of the bone on the beach, the\n unprayable Prayer at the calamitous annunciation?</p><p>There\n is no end, but addition: the trailing Consequence of\n further days and hours, While emotion takes to itself the\n emotionless Years of living among the breakage Of what was\n believed in as the most reliable- And therefore the fittest\n for renunciation.</p><p>There is the final addition, the\n failing Pride or resentment at failing powers, The\n unattached devotion which might pass for devotionless, In a\n drifting boat with a slow leakage, The silent listening to\n the undeniable Clamour of the bell of the last\n annunciation.</p><p>Where is the end of them, the fishermen\n sailing Into the wind's tail, where the fog cowers? We\n cannot think of a time that is oceanless Or of an ocean not\n littered with wastage Or of a future that is not liable\n Like the past, to have no destination.</p><p>We have to\n think of them as forever bailing, Setting and hauling,\n while the North East lowers Over shallow banks unchanging\n and erosionless Or drawing their money, drying sails at\n dockage; Not as making a trip that will be unpayable For a\n haul that will not bear examination.</p><p>There is no end\n of it, the voiceless wailing, No end to the withering of\n withered flowers, To the movement of pain that is painless\n and motionless, To the drift of the sea and the drifting\n wreckage, The bone's prayer to Death its God. Only the\n hardly, barely prayable Prayer of the one Annunciation.</p><p>It\n seems, as one becomes older, That the past has another\n pattern, and ceases to be a mere sequence- Or even\n development: the latter a partial fallacy Encouraged by\n superficial notions of evolution, Which becomes, in the\n popular mind, a means of disowning the past. The moments of\n happiness - not the sense of well-being, Fruition,\n fulfilment, security or affecton, Or even a very good\n dinner, but the sudden illumination— We had the experience\n but missed the meaning, And approach to the meaning\n restores the experience In a different form, beyond any\n meaning We can assign to happiness. I have said before That\n the past experience revived in the meaning Is not the\n experience of one life only But of many generations - not\n forgetting Something that is probably quite ineffable: The\n backward look behind the assurance Of recorded history, the\n backward half-look Over the shoulder, towards the primitive\n terror. Now, we come to discover that the moments of agony\n (Whether, or not, due to misunderstanding, Having hoped for\n the wrong things or dreaded the wrong things, Is not in\n question) are likewise permanent With such permanence as\n time has. We appreciate this better In the agony of others,\n nearly experienced, Involving ourselves, than in our own.\n For our own past is covered by the currents of action, But\n the torment of others remains an experience Unqualified,\n unworn by subsequent attrition. People change, and smile:\n but the agony abides. Time the destroyer is time the\n preserver, Like the river with its cargo of dead negroes,\n cows and chicken coops, The bitter apple, and the bite in\n the apple. And the ragged rock in the restless waters,\n Waves wash over it, fogs conceal it; On a halcyon day it is\n merely a monument, In navigable weather it is always a\n seamark To lay a course by, but in the sombre season Or the\n sudden fury, is what it always was.</p><p>III</p><p>I\n sometimes wonder if that is what Krishna meant- Among other\n things - or one way of putting the same thing: That the\n future is a faded song, a Royal Rose or a lavender spray Of\n wistful regret for those who are not yet here to regret,\n Pressed between yellow leaves of a book that has never been\n opened. And the way up is the way down, the way forward is\n the way back. You cannot face it steadily, but this thing\n is sure, That time is no healer: the patient is no longer\n here. When the train starts, and the passengers are settled\n To fruit, periodicals and business letters (And those who\n saw them off have left the platform) Their faces relax from\n grief into relief, To the sleepy rhythm of a hundred hours.\n Fare forward, travellers! not escaping from the past Into\n different lives, or into any future; You are not the same\n people who left that station Or who will arrive at any\n terminus, While the narrowing rails slide together behind\n you; Watching the furrow that widens behind you, You shall\n not think \"the past is finished\" Or\n \"the future is before us\". At nightfall, in the rigging and\n the aerial, Is a voice descanting (though not to the ear,\n The murmuring shell of time, and not in any language)\n \"Fare forward, you who think that you are voyaging; You are not those who saw the harbour Receding, or those who will disembark. Here between the hither and the farther shore While time is withdrawn, consider the future And the past with an equal mind. At the moment which is not of action or inaction You can receive this: 'on whatever sphere of being The mind of a man may be intent At the time of death' - that is the one action (And the time of death is every moment) Which shall fructify in the lives of others: And do not think of the fruit of action. Fare forward. O voyagers, O seamen, You who came to port, and you whose bodies Will suffer the trial and judgement of the sea, Or whatever event, this is your real destination.\"\n So Krishna, as when he admonished Arjuna On the field of\n battle. Not fare well, But fare forward, voyagers.</p><p>IV</p><p>Lady,\n whose shrine stands on the promontory, Pray for all those\n who are in ships, those Whose business has to do with fish,\n and Those concerned with every lawful traffic And those who\n conduct them.</p><p>Repeat a prayer also on behalf of Women\n who have seen their sons or husbands Setting forth, and not\n returning: Figlia del tuo figlio, Queen of Heaven.</p><p>Also\n pray for those who were in ships, and Ended their voyage on\n the sand, in the sea's lips Or in the dark throat which\n will not reject them Or wherever cannot reach them the\n sound of the sea bell's Perpetual angelus.</p><p>V</p><p>To\n communicate with Mars, converse with spirits, To report the\n behaviour of the sea monster, Describe the horoscope,\n haruspicate or scry, Observe disease in signatures, evoke\n Biography from the wrinkles of the palm And tragedy from\n fingers; release omens By sortilege, or tea leaves, riddle\n the inevitable With playing cards, fiddle with pentagrams\n Or barbituric acids, or dissect The recurrent image into\n pre-conscious terrors- To explore the womb, or tomb, or\n dreams; all these are usual Pastimes and drugs, and\n features of the press: And always will be, some of them\n especially Whether on the shores of Asia, or in the Edgware\n Road, Men's curiosity searches past and future And clings\n to that dimension. But to apprehend The point of\n intersection of the timeless With time, is an occupation\n for the saint— No occupation either, but something given\n And taken, in a lifetime's death in love, Ardour and\n selflessness and self-surrender. For most of us, there is\n only the unattended Moment, the moment in and out of time,\n The distraction fit, lost in a shaft of sunlight, The wild\n thyme unseen, or the winter lightning Or the waterfall, or\n music heard so deeply That it is not heard at all, but you\n are the music While the music lasts. These are only hints\n and guesses, Hints followed by guesses; and the rest Is\n prayer, observance, discipline, thought and action. The\n hint half guessed, the gift half understood, is\n Incarnation. Here the impossible union Of spheres of\n evidence is actual, Here the past and future Are conquered,\n and reconciled, Where action were otherwise movement Of\n that which is only moved And has in it no source of\n movement— Driven by daemonic, chthonic Powers. And right\n action is freedom From past and future also. For most of\n us, this is the aim Never here to be realised; Who are only\n undefeated Because we have gone on trying; We, content at\n the last If our temporal reversion nourish (Not too far\n from the yew-tree) The life of significant soil.</p><p>Little\n Gidding</p><p>I</p><p>Midwinter spring is its own season\n Sempiternal though sodden towards sundown, Suspended in\n time, between pole and tropic. Whem the short day is\n brightest, with frost and fire, The brief sun flames the\n ice, on pond and ditches, In windless cold that is the\n heart's heat, Reflecting in a watery mirror A glare that is\n blindness in the early afternoon. And glow more intense\n than blaze of branch, or brazier, Stirs the dumb spirit: no\n wind, but pentecostal fire In the dark time of the year.\n Between melting and freezing The soul's sap quivers. There\n is no earth smell Or smell of living thing. This is the\n spring time But not in time's covenant. Now the hedgerow Is\n blanched for an hour with transitory blossom Of snow, a\n bloom more sudden Than that of summer, neither budding nor\n fading, Not in the scheme of generation. Where is the\n summer, the unimaginable Zero summer?</p><p>If you came\n this way, Taking the route you would be likely to take From\n the place you would be likely to come from, If you came\n this way in may time, you would find the hedges White\n again, in May, with voluptuary sweetness. It would be the\n same at the end of the journey, If you came at night like a\n broken king, If you came by day not knowing what you came\n for, It would be the same, when you leave the rough road\n And turn behind the pig-sty to the dull facade And the\n tombstone. And what you thought you came for Is only a\n shell, a husk of meaning From which the purpose breaks only\n when it is fulfilled If at all. Either you had no purpose\n Or the purpose is beyond the end you figured And is altered\n in fulfilment. There are other places Which also are the\n world's end, some at the sea jaws, Or over a dark lake, in\n a desert or a city— But this is the nearest, in place and\n time, Now and in England.</p><p>If you came this way,\n Taking any route, starting from anywhere, At any time or at\n any season, It would always be the same: you would have to\n put off Sense and notion. You are not here to verify,\n Instruct yourself, or inform curiosity Or carry report. You\n are here to kneel Where prayer has been valid. And prayer\n is more Than an order of words, the conscious occupation Of\n the praying mind, or the sound of the voice praying. And\n what the dead had no speech for, when living, They can tell\n you, being dead: the communication Of the dead is tongued\n with fire beyond the language of the living. Here, the\n intersection of the timeless moment Is England and nowhere.\n Never and always.</p><p>II</p><p>Ash on an old man's sleeve\n Is all the ash the burnt roses leave. Dust in the air\n suspended Marks the place where a story ended. Dust\n inbreathed was a house- The walls, the wainscot and the\n mouse, The death of hope and despair, This is the death of\n air.</p><p>There are flood and drouth Over the eyes and in\n the mouth, Dead water and dead sand Contending for the\n upper hand. The parched eviscerate soil Gapes at the vanity\n of toil, Laughs without mirth. This is the death of earth.</p><p>Water\n and fire succeed The town, the pasture and the weed. Water\n and fire deride The sacrifice that we denied. Water and\n fire shall rot The marred foundations we forgot, Of\n sanctuary and choir. This is the death of water and fire.</p><p>In\n the uncertain hour before the morning Near the ending of\n interminable night At the recurrent end of the unending\n After the dark dove with the flickering tongue Had passed\n below the horizon of his homing While the dead leaves still\n rattled on like tin Over the asphalt where no other sound\n was Between three districts whence the smoke arose I met\n one walking, loitering and hurried As if blown towards me\n like the metal leaves Before the urban dawn wind\n unresisting. And as I fixed upon the down-turned face That\n pointed scrutiny with which we challenge The first-met\n stranger in the waning dusk I caught the sudden look of\n some dead master Whom I had known, forgotten, half recalled\n Both one and many; in the brown baked features The eyes of\n a familiar compound ghost Both intimate and unidentifiable.\n So I assumed a double part, and cried And heard another's\n voice cry: \"What! are you here?\" Although we were not. I\n was still the same, Knowing myself yet being someone other—\n And he a face still forming; yet the words sufficed To\n compel the recognition they preceded. And so, compliant to\n the common wind, Too strange to each other for\n misunderstanding, In concord at this intersection time Of\n meeting nowhere, no before and after, We trod the pavement\n in a dead patrol. I said:\n \"The wonder that I feel is easy, Yet ease is cause of wonder. Therefore speak: I may not comprehend, may not remember.\"\n And he:\n \"I am not eager to rehearse My thoughts and theory which you have forgotten. These things have served their purpose: let them be. So with your own, and pray they be forgiven By others, as I pray you to forgive Both bad and good. Last season's fruit is eaten And the fullfed beast shall kick the empty pail. For last year's words belong to last year's language And next year's words await another voice. But, as the passage now presents no hindrance To the spirit unappeased and peregrine Between two worlds become much like each other, So I find words I never thought to speak In streets I never thought I should revisit When I left my body on a distant shore. Since our concern was speech, and speech impelled us To purify the dialect of the tribe And urge the mind to aftersight and foresight, Let me disclose the gifts reserved for age To set a crown upon your lifetime's effort. First, the cold fricton of expiring sense Without enchantment, offering no promise But bitter tastelessness of shadow fruit As body and sould begin to fall asunder. Second, the conscious impotence of rage At human folly, and the laceration Of laughter at what ceases to amuse. And last, the rending pain of re-enactment Of all that you have done, and been; the shame Of things ill done and done to others' harm Which once you took for exercise of virtue. Then fools' approval stings, and honour stains. From wrong to wrong the exasperated spirit Proceeds, unless restored by that refining fire Where you must move in measure, like a dancer.\"\n The day was breaking. In the disfigured street He left me,\n with a kind of valediction, And faded on the blowing of the\n horn.</p><p>III</p><p>There are three conditions which\n often look alike Yet differ completely, flourish in the\n same hedgerow: Attachment to self and to things and to\n persons, detachment From self and from things and from\n persons; and, growing between them, indifference Which\n resembles the others as death resembles life, Being between\n two lives - unflowering, between The live and the dead\n nettle. This is the use of memory: For liberation - not\n less of love but expanding Of love beyond desire, and so\n liberation From the future as well as the past. Thus, love\n of a country Begins as an attachment to our own field of\n action And comes to find that action of little importance\n Though never indifferent. History may be servitude, History\n may be freedom. See, now they vanish, The faces and places,\n with the self which, as it could, loved them, To become\n renewed, transfigured, in another pattern. Sin is Behovely,\n but All shall be well, and All manner of thing shall be\n well. If I think, again, of this place, And of people, not\n wholly commendable, Of not immediate kin or kindness, But\n of some peculiar genius, All touched by a common genius,\n United in the strife which divided them; If I think of a\n king at nightfall, Of three men, and more, on the scaffold\n And a few who died forgotten In other places, here and\n abroad, And of one who died blind and quiet, Why should we\n celebrate These dead men more than the dying? It is not to\n ring the bell backward Nor is it an incantation To summon\n the spectre of a Rose. We cannot revive old factions We\n cannot restore old policies Or follow an antique drum.\n These men, and those who opposed them And those whom they\n opposed Accept the constitution of silence And are folded\n in a single party. Whatever we inherit from the fortunate\n We have taken from the defeated What they had to leave us -\n a symbol: A symbol perfected in death. And all shall be\n well and All manner of thing shall be well By the\n purification of the motive In the ground of our beseeching.</p><p>IV</p><p>The\n dove descending breaks the air With flame of incandescent\n terror Of which the tongues declare The one dischage from\n sin and error. The only hope, or else despair Lies in the\n choice of pyre of pyre- To be redeemed from fire by fire.</p><p>Who\n then devised the torment? Love. Love is the unfamiliar Name\n Behind the hands that wove The intolerable shirt of flame\n Which human power cannot remove. We only live, only suspire\n Consumed by either fire or fire.</p><p>V</p><p>What we call\n the beginning is often the end And to make and end is to\n make a beginning. The end is where we start from. And every\n phrase And sentence that is right (where every word is at\n home, Taking its place to support the others, The word\n neither diffident nor ostentatious, An easy commerce of the\n old and the new, The common word exact without vulgarity,\n The formal word precise but not pedantic, The complete\n consort dancing together) Every phrase and every sentence\n is an end and a beginning, Every poem an epitaph. And any\n action Is a step to the block, to the fire, down the sea's\n throat Or to an illegible stone: and that is where we\n start. We die with the dying: See, they depart, and we go\n with them. We are born with the dead: See, they return, and\n bring us with them. The moment of the rose and the moment\n of the yew-tree Are of equal duration. A people without\n history Is not redeemed from time, for history is a pattern\n Of timeless moments. So, while the light fails On a winter's\n afternoon, in a secluded chapel History is now and England.</p><p>With\n the drawing of this Love and the voice of this Calling</p><p>We\n shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our\n exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the\n place for the first time. Through the unknown, unremembered\n gate When the last of earth left to discover Is that which\n was the beginning; At the source of the longest river The\n voice of the hidden waterfall And the children in the\n apple-tree Not known, because not looked for But heard,\n half-heard, in the stillness Between two waves of the sea.\n Quick now, here, now, always— A condition of complete\n simplicity (Costing not less than everything) And all shall\n be well and All manner of thing shall be well When the\n tongues of flames are in-folded Into the crowned knot of\n fire And the fire and the rose are one.</p>",
