Dennis Tedlock. 13\n Poems</p>\n<p>Advice Received</p>\n<p>Don’t ask too many questions. Don’t ask questions about\n religion. Don’t take notes in front of people. If someone\n is chopping wood don’t just stand there.</p>\n<p>Dialogue</p>\n<ul>\n <li>I could tell you a story. It’s the story told to all\n  boys when they are initiated. Do you want me to it? -</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to tell it go ahead. -</p>\n<p>Don’t say that. Say you want me to tell the story.</p>\n<p>The Hunter’s Wife</p>\n<p>1 She looks out the window the snow is falling her\n husband went hunting for elk the boy went along too a\n neighbor thinks he saw them at Red Hill she hasn’t seen the\n sun all day.</p>\n<p>2 She was out in the woods gathering pine nuts and there\n under a tree was a fawn the fawn said -Tie me up. -</p>\n<p>3 The men left her in camp for the day a wounded buck\n charged right into the fire she hit him over the head with\n a frying pan.</p>\n<p>The Fire in Your Fireplace You started it right up with\n one match, it must be your aunt loves you it was quiet for\n awhile but now listen to that fire! The flames go straight\n up it roars! Someone is hungry, it must be your\n great-grandparents every time you eat take a little bread a\n little meat throw it in the fire, say - Great-grandparents!\n Eat! - That’s the shortest prayer there is.</p>\n<p>Winter Solstice Here is the place of fear for four days\n no greasy foods are eaten there is no coffee no trade all\n places of business are closed for ten days no sweepings no\n garbage is taken out of the house no fire is taken out of\n the house not even cigarettes are lighted outside people\n shouldn’t use their cars the street lights are all turned\n out this is the middle of time.</p>\n<p>Recipe Fill a bowl with hot water add, to taste: dried\n leaves of wild mint ground chili onions dried chinchweed\n flowers wolfberries and venison jerky. This is called\n hot-bowl it is an ancient dish.</p>\n<p>Cornshucking Pull down the husk all around then twist it\n all off at once with the stem put the dry ears in this pile\n for us put the damp ears the moldy ears in this one for the\n hogs and throw the shucks out there some of the ears are\n yellow some are blue red white some are pretty the\n multicolored ones some are black look for the\n Fully-Finished-Ear without a single kernel missing right to\n the very tip a deer, a buck wears that one on his breast\n and the Flat-Ear with a forked tip a doe wears that one on\n her breast and the Road-Ear with a groove down its whole\n length runners wear that one on their backs now here it is\n a Fully-Finished-Ear but it’s wet I’ll put it at the edge\n of the good pile and here is an ear yellow, but each kernel\n is tinged with red it’s sort of pretty there’s no name for\n this one I’ll put it here on the fence rail maybe I’ll do\n something with it later.</p>\n<p>#poem</p>\n<p>Tags: poem, Reference</p>"

Urgent tasks\n  are often unimportant and important tasks are often not\n  urgent.</li>\n <li>Concentrate single-mindedly on one thing, the most\n  important thing, and stay with it until it's complete.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>##d. skills:</p>\n<ol>\n <li>Make a list before you begin; always work from a list.</li>\n <li>Set clear priorities on your list; always begin with\n  the most important tasks.</li>\n <li>Resist diversion or distraction; keep saying to\n  yourself \"Back to work!  Back to work!\"</li>\n <li>Practice single-handling with every task -- once you\n  begin, refuse to do anything else until your #1 task is\n  completed.</li>\n <li>When you finish with a task, put everything away.</li>\n <li>One minute in planning saves ten minutes in execution\n  -- a 1000% return on your investment.</li>\n <li>Identify your limiting step: the task or function that\n  determines the speed at which you achieve your goal.</li>\n <li>Define your goal and then ask,\n  \"Why am I not there already? What is holding me back?\"</li>\n <li>With major tasks, you need blocks of uninterrupted\n  time; turn off the telephone!</li>\n <li>Plan every day the evening before; then begin first\n  thing the next morning on your most important task.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>##e. planning:</p>\n<ol>\n <li>Continually write, rewrite and program your goals and\n  activities to keep yourself focused.</li>\n <li>Action without planning is the cause of every failure.</li>\n <li>Neatness is a key personal productivity habit;\n  important tasks are not entrusted to messy people.</li>\n <li>Keep your desk and work area clean and well-organized.\n  Clean it off completely at the end of each day.</li>\n <li>Clear your desk of everything except the one task that\n  you are working on at the moment.</li>\n <li>Handle each piece of paper or information just once;\n  when you pick it up, do something with it.</li>\n <li>30% of your time, on average, can be spent looking for\n  things you've misplaced!</li>\n <li>80% of the materials filed are never needed again;\n  avoid creating filing work for others.</li>\n <li>Use your waste basket generously;\n  \"When in doubt, throw it out.\"</li>\n <li>If it is not necessary to do it, it is necessary not to\n  do it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>##f. procrastination:</p>\n<ol>\n <li>Procrastination is not only the thief of time; but it\n  also is the thief of life and dreams as well.</li>\n <li>The most valuable reputation you can develop is that of\n  a person who gets things done fast.</li>\n <li>When you do things quickly for others, they think you\n  are smarter and more competent.</li>\n <li>As Nietsche wrote,\n  \"A man can bear any what,  if he has a big enough why.\"\n  Overcome procrastination with intensely desired goal</li>\n <li>Visualize, imagine and feel the task is already\n  completed before you begin.</li>\n <li>Set deadlines for yourself on all important tasks and\n  then discipline yourself to meet them.</li>\n <li>Speak to yourself positively all the time:\n  \"Do it now!  Do it now! Do it now!\"</li>\n <li>Refuse to allow yourself to make excuses or\n  rationalizations for procrastination; hold your own feet\n  to the fire.</li>\n <li>Give yourself a reward for each step you take toward\n  completion and goal attainment.</li>\n <li>\"A journey of a thousand leagues begins with a single step.\"\n  Do one thing to get started - now!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>##g. waste:</p>\n<ol>\n <li>Telephone Interruptions Have your calls held or\n  screened. Return them all at the same time.</li>\n <li>Drop-in Visitors Stand up immediately, walk out of your\n  office with them, keep moving.</li>\n <li>Meetings Always have an agenda, start and stop on time;\n  remove all the chairs.</li>\n <li>Unexpected Emergencies Operate in real time; do it now;\n  move quickly to resolve the situation.</li>\n <li>Procrastination Break up the tasks into small chunks;\n  start with the most important -- and keep at it!</li>\n <li>Indecision Most decisions (80%!) should be made when\n  they come up. Make a habit of being decisive.</li>\n <li>Mistakes Take the time to do the job right the first\n  time; be patient and persistent.</li>\n <li>Knowledge Dedicate yourself to personal and\n  professional development; get better at your key tasks.</li>\n <li>Focus Always know exactly what it is you are trying to\n  accomplish, and concentrate all your energies in that\n  direction.</li>\n <li>Socializing Make your conversations short, focused, and\n  to the point. Discuss personal matters away from work.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>##h. multitask:</p>\n<ol>\n <li>Your ability to plan, organize and accomplish complex\n  tasks is essential to your success.</li>\n <li>Project management and time management go hand in hand\n  with high productivity.</li>\n <li>Your ability to bring together a team of people to\n  complete a multi-task job is the mark of executive\n  excellence.</li>\n <li>You begin each project by defining the ideal desired\n  result and working back to the beginning.</li>\n <li>People are not just the only thing; they are\n  everything. Assemble the team first.</li>\n <li>Instill ownership of the project in each team member by\n  involving him or her fully in the planning process.</li>\n <li>Before beginning, list every task, function and\n  activity that must be completed. Assign responsibility and\n  set deadlines for each.</li>\n <li>Inspect what you expect -- if it's important, stay on\n  top of it at all times.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Tags: Ed, NextProject, Reference</p>"
