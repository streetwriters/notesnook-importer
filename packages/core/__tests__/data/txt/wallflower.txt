wallflower

#poem

I am a wallflower
 on a moving wall.

There is a flower 
 on my headrest.
 There is me.

Beside me another
 sees what i see.

The weather and a bird.


The flowers speak 
 when spoken to.

Why not speak of flowers?

“Is that a bird?”


Going somewhere i had never been
 i fell asleep
 and dreamt 
 i arrived.

Trapped by my own objective
 i could only stay, 
 or return.

But when i awoke
 i was only halfway there
 and daylight- 
 everywhere.

So i stood up smiling
 stepped off the wall
 and climbed into the field.
